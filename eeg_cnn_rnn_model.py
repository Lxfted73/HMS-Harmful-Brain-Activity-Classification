text = """The input shape for your CNN-RNN model depends on the format of your EEG data and how
    you're representing it in your model. 

1. **For CNN Input**:
   - The input shape for the CNN part of your model typically depends on the format of your EEG signals and how you're preprocessing them. 
   - If you're treating each EEG signal as a sequence of data points (e.g., voltage values recorded at different time points), your input shape might be `(sequence_length, num_channels)`, where:
     - `sequence_length` is the length of each EEG signal sequence (number of time points or samples).
     - `num_channels` is the number of channels or electrodes used to record the EEG signals.
   - For example, if you have EEG signals sampled at 256 Hz with 19 electrodes, and you're considering 10 seconds of data per sequence, your input shape might be `(2560, 19)`.

2. **For RNN Input**:
   - The input shape for the RNN part of your model depends on how you're representing the temporal information in your EEG data.
   - If you're using fixed-length sequences of EEG data as inputs to the RNN, your input shape might be `(sequence_length, cnn_output_size)`, where:
     - `sequence_length` is the length of each sequence of CNN outputs (number of time steps or segments).
     - `cnn_output_size` is the dimensionality of the CNN output.
   - For example, if your CNN outputs a vector of size 64 for each segment, and you're considering sequences of 100 segments, your input shape might be `(100, 64)`.

Here's how you can define the input shape in your code:

# Define input shapes
cnn_input_shape = (sequence_length, num_channels)
rnn_input_shape = (sequence_length, cnn_output_size)

    cnn_conv2 = layers.Conv1D(128, 3, activation='relu')(cnn_pool1)
    cnn_pool2 = layers.MaxPooling1D(2)(cnn_conv2)
    cnn_flat = layers.Flatten()(cnn_pool2)
    cnn_output = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(cnn_flat)

    # RNN part
    rnn_input = layers.Input(shape=(None, input_shape[1]))
    rnn_lstm = layers.LSTM(64)(rnn_input)

    # Combine CNN and RNN outputs
    combined = layers.concatenate([cnn_output, rnn_lstm])

    # Output layer
    output = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(combined)

    return model

rnn_input_shape = (None, cnn_output_size)  # Define your input shape for RNN (e.g., (None, cnn_output_size))

# Create model
model = create_model(cnn_input_shape, num_classes)

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model (assuming X_cnn_train, X_rnn_train, y_train are your training data)
model.fit([X_cnn_train, X_rnn_train], y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Evaluate the model (assuming X_cnn_test, X_rnn_test, y_test are your test data)
